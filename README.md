# MiniMC - Custom Minecraft Server Platform

> **Role:** Lead Software Engineer  
> **Status:** Closed Source | Production  
> **Focus:** High-Performance Distributed Systems & Game Mechanics

## 📋 Project Overview

MiniMC is a production-grade Minecraft server platform that I architected and developed as part of a three-person team. While my co-founders handle marketing and operations, I serve as the sole software engineer responsible for all technical implementation, infrastructure design, and feature development.

This project has been a significant technical challenge, pushing me to develop sophisticated solutions from the ground up when existing alternatives were either non-existent or failed to meet performance requirements.

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### Core Engineering Challenges

As the lead developer, I've architected and implemented several complex systems:

- **Cross-Server Inventory Synchronization**  
  Designed a real-time inventory sync system that maintains data consistency across multiple server instances, handling edge cases like concurrent modifications and network failures.

- **Distributed Player Warping**  
  Built a seamless cross-server teleportation system with state management, ensuring smooth player transitions between server instances without data loss or duplication.

- **Custom Dungeon Mechanics Engine**  
  Developed a sophisticated dungeon system from scratch, including procedural generation logic, encounter management, and dynamic difficulty scaling.

### Why Custom Solutions?

Each of these systems was built from the ground up due to:
- **Performance Constraints:** Existing solutions couldn't handle our scale or latency requirements
- **Feature Gaps:** Off-the-shelf plugins lacked the specific functionality needed
- **Control & Optimization:** Custom implementations allowed fine-tuned performance optimization

## 💼 Engineering Approach

This project showcases my ability to:

- **Architect Distributed Systems** - Design and implement systems that work reliably across multiple server instances
- **Optimize for Performance** - Make critical decisions about when to build custom solutions vs. using existing libraries
- **Handle Complex State Management** - Ensure data consistency in distributed environments
- **Deliver Production Code** - Write maintainable, reliable code for real users in a live environment

## 🔒 Code Confidentiality

The source code remains closed-source to protect the competitive advantages and proprietary systems developed for this project.
